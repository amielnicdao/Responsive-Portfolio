      <p>I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for taking ideas to something concrete. Being highly interested in the startup ecosystem has
        led me to start a project which, then, brought me to software development. I enrolled into the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp so I can learn how to
        program enough to build out the MVP. It was one of the most challenging experiences I've done, but also one of the most satisfying.
      </p>

      <p>Having finished the bootcamp, I am looking to test my skills and acquire additional knowledge. I have built out other projects and continue to do so.
        In programming, I have found what I can be passionate about doing work I can be proud of.
